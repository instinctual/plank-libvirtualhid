# Windows Driver Package

Windows gamepad support uses a user-mode UMDF2 control driver backed by Virtual
HID Framework. The driver package is separate from the normal C++ library build:
the library remains consumable from MSVC and MinGW/UCRT64, while the driver
package is built with the Microsoft SDK/WDK toolchain.

## Microsoft Store Listing Text

The Windows driver package is not the same product surface as the C++ library,
so Store listing copy should describe the installed driver component.

### Short Description

```text
User-mode virtual HID driver package that enables compatible apps to create virtual gamepads on Windows.
```

### Description

```text
Virtual HID Driver installs the user-mode driver component used by compatible
applications to create virtual HID gamepads on Windows.

The package includes a local diagnostic UI for creating and testing virtual
gamepads. Compatible applications can also request virtual HID gamepads, and
Windows applications that understand standard HID gamepads can discover those
devices.
```

## Architecture

The backend opens the libvirtualhid control device and sends fixed-size C
protocol structures with `DeviceIoControl`. Create requests start a VHF child
device from the requested descriptor, VID/PID, version, and report layout. Input
reports are submitted through VHF, and HID output writes are normalized back to
the C++ output callback path.

The library and installed driver must use the same control-protocol version.
Protocol version 2 expands the report-descriptor capacity to 2048 bytes for the
complete DirectInput PID descriptor; a version mismatch is rejected rather
than interpreting a differently sized request.

Each backend runtime uses one control-file handle for commands and its pending
output read. The driver associates output events with that handle, so feedback
from a virtual gamepad is delivered only to the runtime that created it instead
of being consumed by another libvirtualhid client.

The driver opens a separate VHF source target for each virtual gamepad and
parents that target to the control-file handle that created it. If the creating
process exits or crashes, Windows cleans up gamepads that were not explicitly
destroyed.

The backend reports `requires_installed_driver = true` and only advertises
gamepad/output-report support when the control device can be opened. Keyboard
and mouse support do not require the driver package.

## Build

Build the UMDF package with a Visual Studio generator and the WDK installed:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-windows-driver -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 `
  -DLIBVIRTUALHID_BUILD_WINDOWS_DRIVER=ON -DLIBVIRTUALHID_ENABLE_PACKAGING=ON `
  -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DLIBVIRTUALHID_BUILD_TOOLS=ON
cmake --build cmake-build-windows-driver --config Release `
  --target libvirtualhid_windows_catalog gamepad_adapter virtualhid_control
cpack -G WIX -C Release --config .\cmake-build-windows-driver\CPackConfig.cmake
```

The package defaults to UMDF 2.15, matching the inbox VHF UMDF source driver
while still exposing the framework APIs used by libvirtualhid. The driver links
the MSVC runtime statically so the UMDF host process does not need VC runtime
DLLs beside the driver.

## Developer Install and Validation

Developer helpers live under `scripts/windows`:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\install-driver.ps1 `
  -InfPath .\cmake-build-windows-driver\src\platform\windows\driver\package\Release\libvirtualhid.inf `
  -LogPath .\cmake-build-windows-driver\install-driver.log
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\test-installed-driver.ps1 `
  -GamepadAdapterPath .\cmake-build-windows-driver\examples\Release\gamepad_adapter.exe `
  -GamepadProfile xseries
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\test-browser-gamepad.ps1 `
  -GamepadAdapterPath .\cmake-build-windows-driver\examples\Release\gamepad_adapter.exe `
  -GamepadProfile xseries
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\uninstall-driver.ps1 `
  -Force -RemoveCertificateSubject "CN=libvirtualhid CI Test Driver Signing"
```

The WiX installer also places validation files under the default install root,
`C:\Program Files\libvirtualhid`:

- `tools\windows\gamepad_adapter.exe`
- `tools\windows\virtualhid_control.exe`

The source-tree validation scripts remain developer and CI helpers. They are not
packaged as reviewer-facing MSI validation scripts because the native
`virtualhid_control.exe` tool can create, exercise, and inspect virtual
gamepads interactively.

The install helper stages the INF with `pnputil`, updates an existing
`ROOT\LIBVIRTUALHID` device when present, and creates that root-enumerated
device when it is missing. It uses SetupAPI/NewDev directly, so MSI installs do
not require WDK tools on the target machine.

The installed-driver test fails if the root device is not started, if
`\\.\LibVirtualHid` cannot be opened, or if a held `gamepad_adapter` instance
does not produce a started HID child device. The browser helper launches a
desktop browser at `https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad` and validates that the
browser Gamepad API observes the held virtual controller.

For manual browser validation, run the browser helper with `-KeepBrowserOpen`,
run the interactive UI, or run:

```powershell
tools\windows\gamepad_adapter.exe xseries --hold-seconds 60
```

Then open `https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad` in a normal desktop browser and
press one of the held virtual buttons if the browser requires a gamepad
activation event.

For interactive local validation, run:

```powershell
tools\windows\virtualhid_control.exe
```

The native UI can create, remove, control, and monitor gamepads that it owns.
Buttons are momentary by default, with an explicit lock mode for held inputs.
The UI also shows supported profile features, battery input state, device nodes,
and normalized feedback reports such as rumble, RGB LED, adaptive trigger, and
raw output events. Devices created by another process are not listed yet; that
requires a future Windows control-protocol extension for cross-process
diagnostics.

## Installation Notes

The driver binary is a user-mode UMDF DLL installed through the Windows Driver
Store, not a libvirtualhid `.sys` copied into `C:\Windows\System32\drivers`.
Windows still uses its built-in `WUDFRd.sys` and VHF components under
`System32\drivers`.

The libvirtualhid-specific sign that installation completed is the
`ROOT\LIBVIRTUALHID` root device and the `\\.\LibVirtualHid` control device.
Development driver builds write a lightweight UMDF trace to:

```text
C:\Windows\Temp\libvirtualhid-umdf-driver.log
```

During rapid development reinstalls, the fixed global control symbolic link can
briefly outlive the previous root device. The driver treats that collision as
non-fatal, and normal clients discover the PnP control device interface first.

## Profile Compatibility

The Windows backend publishes HID gamepads through VHF. DirectInput, SDL/HIDAPI,
Windows.Gaming.Input/GameInput, and browser Gamepad API clients should see
standard HID devices after the driver is installed.

The built-in Xbox One profile uses its XboxGIP-shaped HID descriptor. The public
Xbox Series profile remains `VID_045E&PID_0B12`; the Windows transport presents
it with release `0x0509` and the `VID_045E&PID_0B12&IG_00` XInputHID match ID
observed from physical Xbox Series USB and Xbox Wireless Adapter connections.
The VHF child preserves the native 17-byte GIP-shaped input report, including
Share/Misc as button bit 12, and the report parser accepts the native eight-byte
four-motor Xbox payload when a consumer delivers it. Physical Xbox Series USB,
Bluetooth, and Xbox Wireless Adapter transports register in Steam through the
Xbox HIDAPI path with Share mapped as `misc1:b11`; the VHF child does not follow
that same consumer path or guarantee registration as an XInput slot. A
Steam-visible Xbox Series Share button on Windows requires a non-VHF Xbox
HIDAPI/GIP transport. The Xbox 360 profile is rejected by the UMDF/VHF backend
because a real Xbox 360 controller is an XUSB device rather than a VHF HID
gamepad.

DualShock 4 and DualSense answer the calibration, pairing, and firmware feature
requests used by their Windows HIDAPI initialization paths. Switch Pro answers
the native USB and subcommand handshake and submits native `0x30` input reports.
The built-in Generic profile is presented to Windows as a DirectInput PID
Joystick with the complete output-report set required for DirectInput
enumeration. Constant Force and Sine output is normalized to the portable
gamepad rumble callback; other declared effect payloads are ignored safely. The
backend honors PID start delay, duration, and loop count, and automatically
stops finite effects. These changes remain private to the Windows transport and
do not alter the public platform-neutral profile API.

Consumers that display raw HID strings may still show the Windows VHF product
label because VHF does not provide a product/manufacturer string callback.

## Signing

Windows driver packages require a signed catalog for normal installation.
Pull-request builds generate a short-lived self-signed test certificate, sign
`libvirtualhid.cat`, bundle the public certificate into the WiX installer, and
import it into local machine trust stores during install.

Release builds must use Azure Trusted Signing for the catalog and generated MSI
and must not ship the local pull-request test certificate.
