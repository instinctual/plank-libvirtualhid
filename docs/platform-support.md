# Platform Support

`libvirtualhid` keeps the public C++ API platform-neutral. Consumers ask the
runtime for capabilities, create devices from profiles, submit normalized state,
and receive output callbacks. Backend-specific virtual HID details stay inside
the platform implementation.

## Capability Model

Backends report what is available at runtime. A backend can be selectable while
still reporting that a specific device type is unavailable because permissions,
kernel modules, driver installation, or platform features are missing. Device
creation then returns an operation status instead of forcing consumers onto
platform-specific probing code.

Use capability queries for behavior such as:

- Whether the backend can create virtual HID devices.
- Whether gamepad output reports are supported.
- Whether keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, trackpad, or pen tablet creation is
  available.
- Whether the X11/XTest keyboard and mouse fallback is active.
- Whether a Windows driver package must be installed.

## Windows

The Windows backend keeps the normal C++ library buildable with MSVC and
MinGW/UCRT64. Keyboard and mouse input use Win32 APIs. Gamepad creation uses a
user-mode UMDF2 control driver and Windows Virtual HID Framework.

The C++ library communicates with the driver through fixed-size protocol
structures and `DeviceIoControl`, not C++ STL types. This keeps the public API
compiler-neutral and preserves the boundary between the MinGW/MSVC client
library and the WDK/MSVC driver package.

When the driver is installed, the backend publishes HID gamepads that standard
HID consumers can enumerate, including SDL/HIDAPI, DirectInput,
Windows.Gaming.Input/GameInput, and browser Gamepad API clients. XInput is not a
direct target of the HID backend.

The library and driver must use the same Windows control-protocol version. A
descriptor-capacity change therefore increments the protocol version so a
stale installed driver fails creation explicitly instead of misreading the
request.

The built-in Generic profile remains a platform-neutral Game Pad publicly. At
the Windows transport boundary, VHF presents it as a DirectInput-compatible
Joystick with the complete PID output-report contract required by DirectInput.
Constant Force and Sine effects are normalized back into the same rumble
callback used by the other backends; unsupported PID effect payloads are
accepted without producing misleading feedback. Windows also applies
DirectInput's idle-at-maximum Z/Rz trigger polarity. Start delay, duration, and
loop count are honored; finite effects emit a zero-rumble callback when they
expire, while explicit stop commands take effect immediately.

Xbox One uses the native eight-byte PID payload exposed by the Windows Xbox HID
stack. Xbox Series keeps the `0x045E:0x0B12` identity, release `0x0509`, and the
`0x045E:0x0B12&IG_00` XInputHID match ID observed from physical Xbox Series USB
and Xbox Wireless Adapter connections. The VHF device preserves the native
17-byte GIP-shaped input report, including Share/Misc as button bit 12, and the
native eight-byte four-motor rumble payload. Steam maps physical Xbox Series
USB, Bluetooth, and Wireless Adapter transports through its Xbox HIDAPI path
with Share as `misc1:b11`; the Windows VHF Xbox Series child does not follow that
same consumer path or guarantee registration as an XInput slot. A Steam-visible
Xbox Series Share button on Windows requires a non-VHF Xbox HIDAPI/GIP
transport. The public Xbox Series profile remains `0x045E:0x0B12`; the Windows
transport applies the captured release at device creation. Xbox One accepts
native HID rumble writes. The Xbox Series report parser accepts the native
eight-byte four-motor payload when a consumer delivers it, applies its
actuator-enable mask and duration field, and reports the body motors as
normalized low/high-frequency rumble and the independent trigger motors as
trigger-rumble output.

The VHF driver answers the calibration, pairing, and firmware feature reports
used to initialize DualShock 4 and DualSense HIDAPI output. It also answers the
Switch Pro USB and subcommand initialization sequence and accepts the native
`0x30` input layout, so descriptor-aware consumers can initialize those
controllers before sending their native output reports. The Steam Deck profile
uses Valve's `0x28DE:0x1205` USB identity and native 64-byte state and feature
reports. Its single top-level collection is identified as a Generic Desktop
Game Pad while retaining the Valve-native report bytes, so Windows Game
Controllers and generic HID clients can enumerate it even if the Valve-specific
path is unavailable. SDL/HIDAPI can recognize it as a Steam Deck, disable its
desktop mappings, and send native rumble without exposing Valve protocol details
through the public C++ API. The driver seeds a neutral report before exposing the
device, the backend submits another synchronously during creation, and periodic
updates continue afterward. Each backend packet carries an advancing native
sequence number.

See [Windows driver package](windows-driver.md) for build, install, validation,
and signing details.

## Linux

The Linux backend uses standard user-space kernel interfaces:

- `uhid` for descriptor-driven HID gamepads, including Steam Deck.
- `uinput` for Generic, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series, and Switch Pro
  gamepads, plus keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, trackpad, and pen tablet
  devices.
- `libevdev` internally for uinput device construction.
- X11/XTest only as a keyboard and mouse fallback when `uinput` cannot be used
  and an X11 session is available.

Gamepad support normally prefers `uhid` because descriptors, raw HID identity,
feature reports, and output reports matter for controller compatibility.
Generic, Xbox-family, and Switch Pro profiles instead use `uinput` so SDL,
Steam, browser Gamepad API implementations, and other evdev consumers receive
canonical Linux gamepad events. Face buttons, shoulders, menu buttons, stick
clicks, and Guide use their native evdev codes; sticks use absolute axes. Every
uinput gamepad exposes its directional pad through `ABS_HAT0X` and `ABS_HAT0Y`.
Generic and Xbox triggers remain independent analog `ABS_Z` and `ABS_RZ` axes.
Switch Pro uses the Nintendo face-button
positions, button events for ZL/ZR, and `BTN_Z` for Capture. Profiles with rumble
support normalize rumble, constant, periodic, and ramp uinput force-feedback
effects back into the public callback. Each requested playback repetition
restarts the effect's ramp and envelope timing. A zero-length effect remains
active until its explicit stop event, matching the infinite-effect contract used
by SDL and Steam. The Linux backend lets a new uinput device settle before
reading those effects, so an early poll error cannot disable feedback for the
device lifetime. Generated UHID nodes are correlated by stable physical and
unique identifiers when available, with device-name matching used only as a
fallback. PlayStation rumble is read from native UHID interrupt-channel output
reports.

The Generic profile keeps its public `0x1209:0x0001` identity, USB bus, and
Generic device name at the Linux transport boundary. Its uinput device exposes
D-pad directions once through the standard `ABS_HAT0X` and `ABS_HAT0Y` axes,
which avoids changing the raw button capability surface. It uses a compact
Generic button layout rather than the sparse Xbox button slots.

Xbox 360 retains its `0x045E:0x028E` identity, while its Linux uinput device uses
the Bluetooth bus, so consumers select the sparse button mapping.
Xbox One and Xbox Series retain their public USB identities, but their Linux
uinput devices use the corresponding Bluetooth product identities (`0x0B20`
and `0x0B13`, respectively), whose standard consumer mappings match the events
that uinput exposes. Those three Xbox profiles preserve the 15-slot
Linux gamepad button sequence: unused `BTN_C`, `BTN_Z`, `BTN_TL2`, and `BTN_TR2`
slots are advertised but never pressed, keeping face buttons, shoulders, menu
buttons, Guide, L3, and R3 at their expected indices. D-pad directions are
reported through the hat axes and exposed as logical buttons by standard
gamepad consumers.

DualShock 4, DualSense, and Steam Deck remain on `uhid` so their descriptors, motion,
touchpad, battery, feature reports, and profile-specific output reports stay
available. The backend accepts PlayStation output through both UHID interrupt
and control channels. Numbered control-channel output is normalized before
parsing, whether the kernel includes the report number in the payload or
provides it separately on the UHID event.

Steam Deck retains Valve's native identity and emits the 64-byte Deck state
packet periodically so SDL's direct HIDAPI path can initialize before the first
client input arrives. Linux exposes that endpoint as Bluetooth HID so SDL can
own the native hidraw stream directly; advertising it as USB would make the
kernel's `hid-steam` driver claim the virtual endpoint and substitute an evdev
controller. The Generic Desktop/Game Pad descriptor remains available as an
evdev fallback. The backend answers the unit-serial feature query, accepts the
desktop-mapping/settings commands used by SDL, and forwards native `0xEB`
rumble requests through the portable output callback. Each submitted native
packet carries an advancing sequence number.

The backend opens `/dev/uhid` in nonblocking mode, matching the original
asynchronous gamepad registration path. Its event reader is active before
device registration begins, and creation does not report success until the
kernel returns `UHID_START`. This keeps control-channel initialization
available throughout registration and prevents streaming hosts from publishing
a controller before its kernel HID device has started.

On Linux, DualShock 4 and DualSense emit Sony's native `Wireless Controller`
product name for Steam HID discovery. The requested USB or Bluetooth bus,
descriptor, and report framing remain unchanged; in particular, the default
DualShock 4 profile stays on its USB report contract. This transport-only name
is confined to the Linux backend; public profile names, Windows names, and VHF
behavior are unchanged.

Switch Pro keeps its Nintendo identity on the Linux uinput path. This follows
the evdev layout used by Linux-native virtual-controller implementations and
allows standard `FF_RUMBLE` effects without emulating the physical controller's
proprietary initialization handshake.

Linux touchscreen and trackpad contacts use the lowest available multitouch
slot while they are active. A newly placed contact receives a new tracking ID,
including when it reuses a slot released by another contact, so replacing one
finger cannot overwrite another active finger in standard evdev consumers.

On descriptor-driven backends, native Switch Pro output reports `0x01` and
`0x10` are decoded into the normalized low- and high-frequency rumble callback.
The original native report remains available in `GamepadOutput::raw_report`.

The optional `virtualhid_control` diagnostic UI uses SDL3 and Dear ImGui through
the repository CPM lockfile. It is intended to stay on the same UI framework for
Windows, Linux, and future macOS support. Static Linux linking is possible only
when the target distribution provides static archives for all selected backend
and UI dependencies, including SDL3, `libevdev`, and any enabled X11/XTest
libraries. Many distro toolchains intentionally omit some static archives, so
release packaging should keep full static linking as a packaging-mode choice
rather than an unconditional default.

### Permissions

Linux deployment requires both device-node permissions and the kernel modules
for the selected virtual-controller path. Install udev rules such as
`/etc/udev/rules.d/60-libvirtualhid.rules`:

```udev
# Allows libvirtualhid consumers to access /dev/uinput
KERNEL=="uinput", SUBSYSTEM=="misc", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"

# Allows libvirtualhid consumers to access /dev/uhid
KERNEL=="uhid", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```

UHID gamepads use a stable `libvirtualhid/uhid/*` physical path even when the
library is compiled directly into a consuming application. Match that path for
generated `hidraw` and input event nodes because native profiles such as
DualShock 4 and DualSense intentionally do not retain the application's product
name:

```udev
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{phys}=="libvirtualhid/uhid/*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
SUBSYSTEM=="input", KERNEL=="event*", ATTRS{phys}=="libvirtualhid/uhid/*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```

Consuming applications may additionally install name-matched rules for stable
virtual device names, including uinput-backed gamepads:

```udev
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{name}=="Your App Controller*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
SUBSYSTEMS=="input", ATTRS{name}=="Your App Controller*", GROUP="input", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```

For gamepad support, install a modules-load entry such as
`/etc/modules-load.d/60-libvirtualhid.conf`. `hid_playstation` enables the
kernel force-feedback path used by virtual DualShock 4 and DualSense
controllers; descriptor-aware HIDAPI clients can also write their native
output reports through `hidraw`:

```text
uhid
uinput
hid_playstation
```

After installing the rules, load the modules, reload udev, and trigger the
device nodes:

```bash
sudo modprobe uhid
sudo modprobe uinput
sudo modprobe hid_playstation
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger --property-match=DEVNAME=/dev/uinput
sudo udevadm trigger --property-match=DEVNAME=/dev/uhid
```

If input still does not work, add the user running the consuming application to
the `input` group, then log out and back in:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG input $USER
```

## FreeBSD

The FreeBSD backend uses the native evdev compatibility stack through
`libevdev` and uinput. It accepts both `/dev/input/uinput`, which is the native
FreeBSD path, and `/dev/uinput` for environments that provide the Linux-style
alias. It supports the same uinput device categories as the Linux backend:

- Generic, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Xbox Series, DualShock 4, DualSense, Switch Pro,
  and Steam Deck gamepads.
- Keyboard and mouse devices, with X11/XTest available as a fallback.
- Touchscreen, trackpad, and pen tablet devices.

FreeBSD's [uhid(4)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=uhid&sektion=4)
is not the Linux UHID transport. It exposes an existing physical USB HID
interface through `/dev/uhid?`; it does not let a process register a new device
with the kernel HID bus. FreeBSD CUSE applications such as
[uhidd(8)](https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=uhidd&sektion=8) can emulate
a `uhid(4)`-compatible character device for direct consumers, but that is a
different integration surface and is not used by the current backend.

Generic, Xbox-family, Switch Pro, DualShock 4, DualSense, and Steam Deck behavior
therefore uses uinput. Ordinary buttons, sticks, analog triggers, and rumble are available,
but raw HID reports and descriptor-driven features are not.

For each created gamepad, `Gamepad::profile()` reports the effective FreeBSD
uinput capability subset. Motion, touchpad contacts and click, battery state,
RGB LED output, adaptive-trigger output, and raw HID output reports are disabled.
This includes Switch Pro motion and battery state as well as the
PlayStation-specific features. Streaming-host adapters can reject those
operations instead of silently accepting state that uinput cannot expose.

The `uinput` kernel module and a writable uinput device node are required.

## macOS

The macOS backend currently uses CoreGraphics event injection for keyboard and
mouse input. It keeps the same public device model as the other backends:
consumers create keyboard and mouse devices through the runtime and submit the
same normalized event types. Platform details such as macOS virtual key-code
translation, modifier flag tracking, display coordinate scaling, scroll-wheel
preference handling, and CoreGraphics event posting stay inside the backend.

This first backend is not a virtual HID implementation. It does not require a
driver package, but consuming applications still need the normal macOS
permission path for synthetic input, such as Accessibility/Input Monitoring
approval when the host environment enforces it.

Current macOS capabilities:

- Keyboard key press and release using the existing Windows-style portable key
  codes.
- Mouse relative movement, absolute movement on the main display, left/middle/
  right button transitions, and pixel-based vertical/horizontal scroll.
- Shared keyboard modifier state on mouse events, so combinations such as
  shift-click continue to work.

Unsupported macOS capabilities currently return `unsupported_profile`:

- Gamepad devices and output reports.
- Touchscreen, trackpad, and pen tablet devices.
- Keyboard text input through `KeyboardTextEvent`.

Native macOS virtual-HID gamepad support is planned. A future backend may use
`IOHIDUserDevice`, DriverKit/HIDDriverKit, or a combination that preserves the
same public API while documenting any signing, entitlement, and installer
requirements.
