# Microsoft Store Review Validation

These instructions are intended for Microsoft Store certification review of the
libvirtualhid Windows driver installer. The reviewer does not need to build the
project, install the Windows SDK/WDK, or write a consumer application.

The Windows package installs a user-mode UMDF/VHF virtual HID driver. The
libvirtualhid-specific driver binary is a UMDF DLL installed through the Windows
Driver Store. It is not a kernel-mode `.sys` driver.

## Submission Notes

Paste this into the Partner Center certification notes field:

```text
This package installs the libvirtualhid Windows user-mode UMDF/VHF virtual HID
driver. Applications consume it through the libvirtualhid client API, and the
MSI includes a native diagnostic UI for local validation.

A prebuilt native validation tool is installed by the MSI so no programming,
SDK setup, or driver build environment is required. Please install the released,
production-signed MSI, then launch the validation tool below.

Default install root:
C:\Program Files\libvirtualhid

Installed validation files:
C:\Program Files\libvirtualhid\tools\windows\virtualhid_control.exe
C:\Program Files\libvirtualhid\tools\windows\gamepad_adapter.exe

Required validation:
$installRoot = Join-Path $env:ProgramFiles "libvirtualhid"
& "$installRoot\tools\windows\virtualhid_control.exe"

In the libvirtualhid control window, leave the default Xbox Series profile
selected and click Create. Use the button and axis controls in the UI to submit
input to the virtual controller.

Expected result:
- The UI launches without requiring SDK or WDK tools.
- The backend status reports windows-umdf with gamepad support available.
- A virtual HID gamepad is created and appears in the device list.
- A virtual HID gamepad child device starts, matching either
  HID\VID_045E&PID_0B12&IG_00 or HID\VID_045E&PID_02FF&IG_00.
- Button and axis values in the UI can be pressed or moved without errors.

Optional browser validation:
$installRoot = Join-Path $env:ProgramFiles "libvirtualhid"
& "$installRoot\tools\windows\virtualhid_control.exe"

Create the default Xbox Series gamepad, then open:
https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad

Use the libvirtualhid control window to press buttons or move axes while the
browser page is open.

Expected result:
- Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or another desktop browser opens a gamepad
  test page.
- The browser Gamepad API sees an Xbox-compatible controller.
- Button and axis values change while controls are used in the validation UI.

The installed virtualhid_control.exe and gamepad_adapter.exe binaries are built
with the static MSVC runtime, so they do not require the Visual C++
Redistributable to be installed separately.
```

## Manual Review Steps

1. Install the released, production-signed
   `libvirtualhid-Windows-Driver-installer.msi`.
2. Reboot only if Windows reports that a reboot is required.
3. Open PowerShell.
4. Run the required validation tool from the submission notes.
5. Optionally run the browser validation steps.

If the default install location was changed during MSI installation, replace
`$env:ProgramFiles\libvirtualhid` with the selected install directory.

The MSI writes the driver-install transcript to:

```text
C:\ProgramData\libvirtualhid\install-driver.log
```

## Scope Notes

The `x360` profile is not used for Store review. The Windows UMDF/VHF backend is
HID-only and intentionally does not emulate the Xbox 360 XUSB stack.

The reviewer-visible success signal is the installed `ROOT\LIBVIRTUALHID`
control device, the `\\.\LibVirtualHid` control path, and a started HID gamepad
child device while `virtualhid_control.exe` has a gamepad created.
